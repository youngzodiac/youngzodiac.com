                    <p class="lyrics">
                        Fantasize about that dirty sprite
                        And understand a kid thats white
                        Grippin on a kitchen knife and boutta end my fucking life
                        Swear I’ve tripped a thousand times
                        I don’t wanna die young
                        Leave some flowers on my lone lost grave

                        In this life, there’s some things I cannot leave
                        Rolling up these ganja trees, till my blackened lungs bleed
                        Shattered hearts and littered minds
                        Come and break me one more time
                        Stick this knife into my side

                        I’ve got problems with this life
                        Hang on nooses every night
                        Dreaming lucid while I write
                        Shooting cupid out the sky
                        All the love in me has died
                        All I love to do is ride
                        If I fuck up one more time,
                        It’s a broken suicide, yuh
                        Broken suicide
                        Shattered hearts and littered minds
                        Come and break me one more time
                        Stick this knife into my side
                        Take my heart and lose your life

                        I’ve got problems with this life
                        Hang on nooses every night
                        Dreaming lucid while I write
                        Shooting cupid out the sky
                        All the love in me has died

                        Everything is all inside
                        I don’t know if I’ll be fine
                        I’ve been cutting all these ties,
                        They don’t ride
                        I got fucking loose screws in my mind
                        I’ve been tripping out on time
                        As I’m gripping on my knife
                        And I fucking pull it blind

                        I’ve got problems with this life
                        Hang on nooses every night
                        Dreaming lucid while I write
                        Shooting cupid out the sky
                        All the love in me has died
                        All I love to do is ride
                        If I fuck up one more time
                        It’s a broken suicide

                        If I fuck up one more time
                        It’s a broken suicide
                        All the love in me has died
                        I’ve been tripping out on time

                        It’s alright

                        It’s alright

                        It’s alright

                        I don’t wanna die young
